This is a static HTML GitHub Pages site.

It was originally setup using the Jekyll site generator, but when we paired the site down to just a homepage it was more expedient to manipulate the index.html than to learn the re-create site generator.

So, editing the index.html and related HTML resources will shortly thereafter update the site on https://codeforgreenville.org.
